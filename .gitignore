# PyCharm
#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
.idea/

# Visual Studio Code
#  Visual Studio Code specific template is maintained in a separate VisualStudioCode.gitignore 
#  that can be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file. However, if you prefer, 
#  you could uncomment the following to ignore the entire vscode folder
