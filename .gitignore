#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
.idea/

# Ignore everything in .vscode
.vscode/*

# Allow shared workspace settings
!.vscode/settings.json

# Allow extension recommendations (optional)
